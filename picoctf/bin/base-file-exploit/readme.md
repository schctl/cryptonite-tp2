# basic-file-exploit

We get the source code to an interactive program that can store and read some data. Our goal is to
get the program to output this flag variable

```c
static const char* flag = "[REDACTED]";
```

Interestingly, we see a line that does exactly that

```c
if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
}
```

We just need to get `strtol` to error out then.

Running the program and feeding it invalid data at the branch will cause it to do just that.
