# GDB Baby Steps 1

A very straightforward challenge, we download the binary file and toss it into GDB. We only
need one command for this

    disassemble main

Which gives us the following output:

```assembly
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   %rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:     mov    %rsp,%rbp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:     mov    %edi,-0x4(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:    mov    %rsi,-0x10(%rbp)
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    $0x86342,%eax
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    %rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```

We can see that `eax` contains the value `0x86342` which when converted to decimal is `549698`, which
is our flag!

_sidenote_: you can also

    set disassembly-flavor intel

Intel syntax is more commonly read and understood, the output will look like

```assembly
Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000000000001129 <+0>:     endbr64
   0x000000000000112d <+4>:     push   rbp
   0x000000000000112e <+5>:     mov    rbp,rsp
   0x0000000000001131 <+8>:     mov    DWORD PTR [rbp-0x4],edi
   0x0000000000001134 <+11>:    mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x10],rsi
   0x0000000000001138 <+15>:    mov    eax,0x86342
   0x000000000000113d <+20>:    pop    rbp
   0x000000000000113e <+21>:    ret
End of assembler dump.
```
